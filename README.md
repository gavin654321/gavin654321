Coding experience
I have been taking computer science at GA for two tears now.
I also took a course in middle school about it.
I also try and code in my own time sometimes
Reason to take class
Ever since I took the class in middle school I have always been fascinated by coding
I also really like the idea of knowing how the devices that I use everyday work
Other interests
I like spending time with friends, diving, and other sports
Goals for this class
My main goal for taking computer science in general is to get a better understanding of technology
My main goal this year is to try and build new skills that I did not have last year to make my projects even better
